\chapter*{Dedication}

\hfil \emph{\larger to my \st{cruel} caring uncle Baron Vladimir Harkonnen}
\newline\newline\newline\newline\noindent\hinttext{You may dedicate your work to somebody. For instance, a person, group, organization or even a pet. You may write more than a line or put a graphic\footnote{Make sure you reference the source appropriately if you do so.} here.}

\hinttext{Dedicating to dissolved groups or deceased individuals is permissible. This section just has to make sense to you and the person or entity that you dedicate your work to.}

\hinttext{However, others that read your thesis may see this. Keep in mind that your thesis will be archived and publicly visible. So, avoid anything that could be considered as \emph{problematic} or that could be \emph{misunderstood} by a third party. The dedication above is definitely a bad example!}
